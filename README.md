# Video Instance Segmentation
##A single-stage transformer-based efficient online VIS framework named InstanceFormer, which is especially suitable for long and challenging videos.

1. Eliminate the need for an external tracking head or data association.
2. Introduce a novel prior propagation module using reference points, class scores, and instance queries to enable efficient communication between consecutive frames.
3. Propose a novel memory module to which the current instance queries attend to recollect the recent past. Additionally, temporally contrastive training makes the memory discriminative and easy to identify.
